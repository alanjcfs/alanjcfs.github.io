# Prospero's Revisions

Ye solid-state things, cache, buses, registers  
And ye that on the silicon with humming fan  
Do chase the counting Number and do fly him  
When he comes back; you trite adapter that  
By Tesla do the blue electric make  
Whereof is insulated, and you whose pastime  
Is to launch daemon processes, that rejoice  
To reap the solemn children; by whose aid,  
Weak parents though ye be, I have unplugged  
The power supply, tapped into the processor,  
And 'twixt the gray cable and azured boards  
Set roaring war: to the dread rattling graphics  
Have I given floating tasks imprecise  
Rended itself; the math-based promontory  
Have I made shake and by the hooks plucked up  
The bytes and double words: Threads at my command  
Have executed and returned their values thus  
By my so potent art. But this rough program  
I here abjure, and, when I have required  
Some cycling timer, which even now I do,  
To work my code upon their users that  
This airy fork is for, I'll break my keyboard,  
Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,  
And deeper than recursion ever stacks  
I'll drown my base condition.
