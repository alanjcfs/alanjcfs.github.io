My Code is Laid Away in Git  
I have one Commit more  
A Bug whom I have never seen  
But oft has scanned me o'er

And iterated me between  
And others at my side  
And forked the best, neglecting me  
Till all the rest have died

How sweet, if I am not rebased  
By chums that laid away  
Since codemates at threescore and ten  
Are such a scarcity.
