The GitHub Universe

It was a pretty good conference. We met with Scott Chacon, who helped found
GitHub and turned out to have learned a bit of ASL when our group finally had a
chance to meet and shake hands with him at the end of the conference.

We had some networking opportunities, but mostly we took this time to attend
several interesting conferences: The newly announced Git LFS, FIDO U2F security,
Electron, the open source project used in many projects, including the Atom
editor.

We enjoyed the presentation by Dr. Michael B. Johnson who works at Pixar. He
presented first by giving us a storyboard that turned out not to be in the movie
and explained why it didn’t feel right, and then gave us the scene that actually
made it into the movie. The focus on endless iteration
to make the right story was important and similar to programming.

The AfterParty at the Village was fun and I managed to meet some new people. I
tried out [http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-smartest-ways-to-network-at-a-party-1442249499](some techniques) I learned about trying to analyze body languages to
determine whether people were interested in meeting new people or not.

The final presentation by Marco Annunciate was an interesting introduction to
how General Electrics, which isn’t regarded as a software company, completely
transformed in the last few years by hiring thousands of software developers
working on difficult, big-data analytics everyday and turning it into a
trillion-dollar business.
