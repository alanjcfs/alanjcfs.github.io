Soundless explosion, consciously recalled. Touchless as the land on which you
step. And as the dust colors you faceless like a mannequin, under your headscarf
I see a wide grin and imagined eyes squinting back at me like the buoyant sun.
But you outshine. And I think the wind soundlessly embraces you, coyly prying
away that billowing raiment to which you clutch for fear that it will finally
heed the exhortations of the wind and fly away and be called a moop.
