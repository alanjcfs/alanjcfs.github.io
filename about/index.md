# About Me

I'm a biochemist by education, a web developer by trade.  I went to school to
get a biochemistry degree.  I wind up working in a web development industry.
I think it shows that even if you choose a totally unrelated major, you can
still change career.

Programming is great fun!  It's more fun than being in a laboratory.  The
greatest lesson I was taught was at a defunct company called <a
  href="http://www.brilliantecho.com">Brilliant Echo</a>, which was about how
we should not be afraid to fail.  A program crash is how you learn new things.
And you can't expect to succeed the first time.  Programming is about
attitude, not aptitude.  Everything's all right.

* My command-line tools: ZSH, Vim (Huge), Git.  Occasionally, Sublime Text 3.
* My languages: Ruby, HTML, CSS.  Learning Rust.
