    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was an intern once, for something I didn't regard as particularly
useful. I spent 200 hours, divided into segment of four-hour period,
working on the farm, where I helped a former plant biologist
transplant seedlings from a small pot of soil to a bigger pot.
They are then placed in the farmland, and they are grown organically,
using drop irrigation to avoid wasting water, in Sunol.
For the effort, I received something like $200. It was a fantastic
experience, and almost gave me a green thumb. Almost. Alas, after the
internship was over, my plant-growing ability has not improved at all,
nor has my interest ever burgeoned into an obsession or a routine ---
I have not watered any plant lately.</p>

<p>I am an intern again, for a different field entirely, and I am excited.</p>
