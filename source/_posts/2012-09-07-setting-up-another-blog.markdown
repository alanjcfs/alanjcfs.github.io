I have set up another blog after I found that Jekyll Bootstrap was stagnant.
Of course, ideally a framework should hardly change, but I feel more confident
about Octopress for being the work of multiple programmers than about 
Bootstrap, which has been left behind by its creator in favor of creating a 
language-agnostic blogging platform. I will attempt move some stuff from
the old framework to the new.
