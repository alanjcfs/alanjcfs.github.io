This is not me.

Alan Fung-Schwarz. I thought my name was unique until I found out
two men got married and joined their names together. Perhaps there will be
many Fung-Schwarzes, if Fung and Schwarz were common names.

I am Deaf. I called myself hard of hearing until I learned American Sign Language
and joined the Deaf community. I didn't start learning ASL until 17. Before that,
I had a book that actually taught Signed English, and my conception of sign
language was that it was a representation of English. While I was in high school,
I took an ASL night class during one summer and another during the fall of my senior 
year in high school at Chabot College in Hayward. The book, 
[A Basic Course in American Sign Language][1] gave me an inkling of grammatical 
structures, but did not offer many opportunities to practice nor information
on attending Deaf events. It was at [CSU Hayward-East Bay][2] that I had a
teacher who required me to go to Deaf events to get points that I actually
participated in the community.

Deafness is very much a part of my life, I suppose as much as music can be
a part of a hearing person's life --- expressed in their instant recognition of
a melody.
