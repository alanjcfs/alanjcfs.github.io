		<h1>Accessibility (A11y) Information!</h1>

		<p>I want to be able to avoid using interpreters, but I accept that
			interpreters are necessary, especially in meetings with more than
			two people.</p>

		<p>
			My preferred interpreting agencies are <a
				href="https://www.interpreter-now.com">Interpreter Now</a> and <a
				href="https://dspa.org/">Deaf Services of Palo Alto</a>. I used to use
			Interpreter Now at NerdWallet.
		</p>

		<p>
			Secondarily, I can also fall back to captioning services (also provided
			by Interpreter Now), or by <a href="https://www.acscaptions.com/">ACS</a> or
			<a href="https://whitecoatcaptioning.com/">White Coat Captioning</a>
		</p>

		<p>
			In a pinch, using Google Meet, which provides automatic captioning, also
			can be helpful, but comes with all the shortcoming of using technology,
			which is that it expects everyone to conform to the Machine or be
			mistranscribed. It also can transcribe in a manner that's incredibly wrong
			and/or incomprehensible. It simply cannot be trusted to provide accurate
			transcription in situations that demand comprehension and where
			miscommunication can result in tragedy as opposed to something people like
			to laugh about.
