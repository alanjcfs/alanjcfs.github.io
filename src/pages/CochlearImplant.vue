			I got a cochlear implant in August 2020 and was activated in September.
			This was my first significant surgery.
		</p>

		<p>
			This was after 36 years of being deaf, and 32 years of wearing hearing aids.
			I went through speech therapy. The outcome of that was that I can speak better
			than I can hear. I decided after thinking about it for a long time, and after
			being in the Deaf community, learning ASL when I was 17, that getting the
			implant was an important step toward self-improvement.
		</p>

		<p>
			The implant — even though it allowed me to hear quiet sound, like hearing
			a crinkling bag in a grocery story from far away — wasn’t a panacea.
			It turns out that my brain had a lot of work
			it needed to do to comprehend speech and this is a long ongoing process.
